WEBLAMP 442 - Project
============

What did I build?
Imbibe is a site that will be compendium of cocktails, grogs, punches, and elixirs. It is a repository for the cocktail recipers that I have collected that are currently stored in paper folders and word documents. The site will allow me to archive these recipes, add new ones, edit recipes, and most important allows them to be easily searchable. Initially I have built a 'Cocktail of the Week' page that also uses the Facebook Open Graph.

How have I applied the knowledge gained from the class?
- I have used OO PHP (Cocktail object)
- I use Composer to load dependencies and class map
- PHPUnit has been implemented for testing
- MySQL is used to store the cocktails
- I am using Redbean as a DAO layer
- Facebook Open Graph is being accessed via a 'Like' button
